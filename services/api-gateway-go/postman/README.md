# Postman - Gateway BFF (v2)

This version stores request URLs as **strings** (instead of url.raw objects), which fixes the UI issue where Postman shows an empty URL field.

Import both:
1) `ecommerce-bff-e2e.postman_collection.json`
2) `ecommerce-gateway-local.postman_environment.json`

Select environment: **ecommerce-gateway-local**
